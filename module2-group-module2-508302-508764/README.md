# CSE330  

## Instructions of using the site!
To login, we save three names: "Ica", "Dijkstra", and "guest" as valid usernames. After logging in, the user can see the user interface will choices of upload, view, remove and logout. If any upload or removal of file is failed, the user will be tutored to a page that shows them it fails and provides a button for them to go back to the user interface. If the user is not logged in, the page of view, upload, and remove files cannot be seen and he will be directed to the login page.

For the creative portion, we designs several features
- If the incorrect username is entered or nothing is entered, there will be a warning saying that "User does not exist!"
- People can also see the related information (file size and latest editing time (CST)) when they get to the view files site
- If the user is not logged in, we have a special judgement that avoids errors with using nonexisting variables like the username
